### db setup

see [db_schema.sql](./db_schema.sql) for the updated schema (i used dbdiagram.io to actually plan it out properly)

```sh
sudo -u postgres -i
createdb 2d20fallout
psql 2d20fallout
```

```sql
CREATE ROLE svelte WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'thisisonlyatest';
CREATE SCHEMA new_content;
SET search_path TO new_content;

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA new_content TO svelte;
```

```sh
npx drizzle-kit pull
```
